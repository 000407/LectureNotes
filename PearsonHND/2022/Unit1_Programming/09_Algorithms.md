## 9.1 Algorithms

- An algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.
- Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing.
- Examples
	- Searching: Finding a specific element in a collection
		- Linear Search
		- Binary Search
	- Sorting: Arranging the elements of a linear data structure, in the ascending/descending order of a specific field value
		- Bubble Sort
		- Insertion Sort
		- Selection Sort

## 9.2 Searching Algorithms

- Searching algorithms are used to find a specific item in a collection.
- There are two basic algorithms for searching an item.

### 9.2.1 Linear Search

- The traversal begins from the first item of the data structure.
- Each item is evaluated to check if it is the item that is being searched for.
- The search stops when it hits the item that's being searched for.
- Performance: If it takes $t$ milliseconds to evaluate each item,
	- Best case occurs when the item that's being searched for, is found at the first location. Then it will take only $t$ seconds.
	- Average case occurs when the item was found in the midway of the traversal. This will take $t \times n/2$ seconds.
